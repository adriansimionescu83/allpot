AllPot is a Rails web app created in collaboration with my colleagues Salam Baalbaki and Shuja Khan during the last 2 weeks of Le Wagon bootcamp (https://www.lewagon.com).

Tired of throwing away spoiled ingredients? Trying to become vegan but now sure what to cook? Do you care about our planet's environment but think it'll take a lot of effort to do something about it?

AllPot helps you live by your values and say goodbye to waste by inspiring you with delicious recipes that are based on the ingredients that are in your own kitchen.

Every time you finish cooking a recipe, you'll be able to add any ingredients to a shopping list so that you won't forget to buy it the next time you go grocery shopping. At the same time, those ingredients will be removed from your digital pantry, which means less work for you!

Find a recipe that looks delicious but have a few missing ingredients? Simply add it to your favorites, add those items to your shopping list and cook it later!

Friends asking you to cook that delicious Green Thai Curry that you made them last time? Don't worry about searching for it again. You can easily find it in your cooked list under My Recipes.

So, simply choose a delicious recipe and let AllPot save the planet for you! What's for dinner tonight? Ask AllPot!
